## Welcome to Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator 

This simulator was built for [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/drive), to teach students how to train cars how to navigate road courses using deep learning. See more [project details here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).

All the assets in this project require Unity. Please follow the instructions below for the full setup.

### Unity Simulator User Instructions

1. source the project to your local directory, please make sure to use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) to properly pull over large texture and model assets. 

2. Install the free game making engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com), if you dont already have it. Unity is necessary to load all the assets.

3. Load Unity, Pick load exiting project and choice the `self-driving-car-sim` folder.

4. Load up scenes by going to Project tab in the bottom left, and navigating to the folder Assets/1_SelfDrivingCar/Scenes. To load up one of the scenes, for example the Lake Track, double click the file LakeTrackTraining.unity. Once the scene is loaded up you can fly around it in the scene viewing window by holding mouse right click to turn, and mouse scroll to zoom.

5. Play a scene. Jump into game mode anytime by simply clicking the top play button arrow right above the viewing window.

6. View Scripts. Scripts are what make all the different mechanics of the simulator work and they are located in two different directories, the first is Assets/1_SelfDrivingCar/Scripts which mostly relate to the UI and socket connections. The second directory for scripts is Assets/Standard Assets/Vehicle/Car/Scripts and they control all the different interactions with the car.

7. Building a new track. You can easily build a new track by using the prebuilt road prefabs located in Assets/RoadKit/Prefabs click and drag the road prefab pieces onto the editor, you can snap road pieces together easily by using vertex snapping by holding down "v" and dragging a road piece close to another piece.

- None detected at the snapshot root; consult the upstream documentation link in the Upstream section.

Overlay configuration (Anticloud):

- `anticloud/` - improvement overlay; environment-driven, no cloud dependency
- `LEDGERS/` - aioss tamper-evident chain files (per-project, verified with `aioss verify --live`)
- `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/` - reproducibility record (environment, reproduction steps, result register, evidence)
- `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` - 26 framework assessments for this project

---

## Contributing

Upstream contributions: fork the `SELF_DRIVING` project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request against upstream. Keep `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` untouched in this packaging; put improvements in the `anticloud/` overlay.

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
